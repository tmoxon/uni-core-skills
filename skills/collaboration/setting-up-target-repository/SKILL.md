# Setting Up Target Repository

## Overview

Prepare the `/target` repository for feature development by creating a new branch and ensuring the project is ready for implementation.

**Core principle:** Clean branch + verified setup = reliable development environment.

**Announce at start:** "I'm setting up the target repository for feature development."

## Setup Process

Work directly in the `/target` directory which contains the main project repository.

## Branch Creation

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
cd /target
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- Feature: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix: `fix/bug-description`
- Refactor: `refactor/component-name`

### 2. Run Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

### 3. Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure target repository starts clean:

```bash
# Examples - use project-appropriate command
npm test
cargo test
pytest
go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### 4. Report Location

```
Target repository ready in /target
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |
| Branch already exists | Checkout existing or create with different name |
| Dependencies missing | Auto-detect and install based on project files |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping baseline test verification**
- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Always run tests before starting implementation

**Assuming project setup requirements**
- **Problem:** Breaks on projects using different tools
- **Fix:** Auto-detect from project files (package.json, etc.)

**Proceeding with failing tests**
- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed

**Hardcoding setup commands**
- **Problem:** Breaks on projects using different tools
- **Fix:** Auto-detect from project files (package.json, etc.)

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm setting up the target repository for feature development.

[Create branch: git checkout -b feature/auth]
[Run npm install]
[Run npm test - 47 passing]

Target repository ready in /target
Tests passing (47 tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement auth feature
```

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking
- Skip dependency installation when needed
- Assume project setup requirements

**Always:**
- Create clean feature branch
- Auto-detect and run project setup
- Verify clean test baseline
- Work directly in /target repository
